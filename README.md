# solar-system
Hobby Unity project where I can generate celestial bodies and have them interact through gravity


Inspired by Sebastian Lague's Coding Adventures on YouTube, I decided to try building a solar system.
Turns out he made a tutorial series for procedural planet generation, which I followed to make most
of this. Some things I also ripped from the new Coding Adventures, like the physics system.
